/* 24 Game
http://rosettacode.org/wiki/24_game#JavaScript
The 24 Game tests one's mental arithmetic.
Write a program that randomly chooses and displays four digis, each from one to nine, with repetitions allowed.
The program should prompt for the player to enter an arithmetic expression using just those four digits,
and all of those four digits, used exactly once each.
The program should check and then evaluate the expression.
The goal is for the player to enter an expression that evaluates to 24.
The Rules:
* Only multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction operators or functions are allowed.
* Division should use floating point, rational arithmetic, or something similar to preserve remainders.
* Brackets are allowed, if using an infix expression evaluator.
* Forming multiple digit numbers from the supplied digits is not allowed (An answer of 12+12 when given 1,2,1,2 is wrong)
* The given order of the digits does not have to be preserved.
* The type of expression evaluator used is not mandated. An RPN evaluator is equally acceptable for example.
* The task is not for the program to generate the expression, or test whether the expression is even possible.
